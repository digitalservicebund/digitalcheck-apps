# 2. Use React as the frontend framework

Date: 2024-05-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The context is similar to the one described for the [tool-finder here](../../../tool-finder/doc/adr/0003-use-react.md).
Additionally, the components already developed for the tool-finder should be re-used.

## Decision

We will use React as the frontend framework since it aligns well with the outlined requirements and considerations.

## Consequences

The consequences are similar to the ones described for the [tool-finder here](../../../tool-finder/doc/adr/0003-use-react.md).
